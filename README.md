Decentralized video platform on ZeroNet using [WebTorrent](http://webtorrent.io/)

This is still a proof of concept.

### Why ?

Because I can.

### TODO

- [x] React migration
- [x] Login/Logout
- [x] Search videos
- [ ] Improve the search experience
  - [ ] Search by username
  - [ ] Adding filters
- [x] Adding video
- [x] "How it works ?" page
- [ ] Swagger home page needed
  - [ ] Front page style (adding upvote/downvote system)
- [x] Profile page
- [ ] Add same hash video link
- [ ] Adding comment
- [ ] Write test and stop breaking things (<-- lel)
- [ ] Add it to gittorrent

And that would be nice to have that so far...

### Notes

I am thinking of using the merger site feature so one hub would be a channel. It would allow people to create a channel and allow everyone to add videos to it or only some selected people. Everyone could follow a channel. It would make the search only effective in the channel that we are already following but it would allow to split database and ignore thing that we are not interested in.

I also like the idea to have several account being able to publish on a channel instead of youtube way of doing 1 username = 1 channel.
